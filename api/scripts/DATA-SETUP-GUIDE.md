# Run population script
node runPopulation.js
```

### Method 2: Batch File
```bash
# Double-click populate-data.bat
# Or run from command line:
cd "C:\Users\91983\Desktop\Habit Tracker\api\scripts"
populate-data.bat
```

### Method 3: API Endpoint
```bash
# If server is running on port 3000
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/bulk-users/populate
```

### Method 4: Comprehensive Population
```bash
# For detailed population with all features
node populateUserData.js
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

### After Population:
```javascript
// Database will contain:
✅ 12 users with levels 2-6
✅ 60-80 total habits across all users  
✅ Varied habit categories for good matching
✅ Realistic completion histories
✅ Different activity levels and preferences
✅ Compatible timezone settings (UTC+5:45)
```

### Partner Matching Will Show:
```javascript
// Compatibility Examples:
- Sandesh (Health+Productivity) ↔ Bikash (Health+Learning) = 75-85% match
- Anisha (Wellness+Social) ↔ Kabita (Creative+Wellness) = 70-80% match  
- Pratik (Learning+Career) ↔ Nirajan (Learning+Career) = 85-95% match
- High activity users will match better with each other
- Similar levels will have higher compatibility
```

## 🧪 Testing Partner Discovery

### Step-by-Step Test:
1. **Register Users** (if not done):
   ```bash
   node simpleUserRegistration.js
   ```

2. **Populate Data**:
   ```bash
   node runPopulation.js
   ```

3. **Test Partner Matching**:
   - Login as Sandesh (sandesh@mail.com / sandesh@123)
   - Go to Partners section (/partners)
   - Click "Discover Compatible Partners"
   - Should see 8-11 potential partners with match scores

4. **Verify Compatibility**:
   - Check match scores (should range 60-95%)
   - Verify common categories are highlighted
   - Test challenge and motivation features

### Expected Partner Matches:
```javascript
// High Compatibility (85%+ matches):
- Pratik ↔ Nirajan (Learning + Career focus)
- Sandesh ↔ Dipesh (Health + Productivity)
- Anisha ↔ Sita (Wellness focus)

// Medium Compatibility (70-84%):
- Sujan ↔ Sarita (Wellness + Creative)
- Sagar ↔ Ramesh (Productivity + Finance)
- Kabita ↔ Anisha (Creative + Social)

// Good Compatibility (60-79%):
- Cross-category matches with some overlap
- Different activity levels but shared goals
```

## 🔍 Verification

### Check Population Success:
```bash
# Method 1: Database query
# Connect to MongoDB and run:
db.users.find({}, {username: 1, level: 1, goals: 1, "stats.currentStreak": 1})

# Method 2: Count habits
db.habits.countDocuments()
# Should return 60-80 habits

# Method 3: API check
curl http://localhost:3000/api/bulk-users/list
```

### Expected Console Output:
```
📊 Population Complete!
✅ Users updated: 12
✅ Habits created: 68
📈 Average habits per user: 5.7

👥 User Levels:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### "No Partners Found"
```bash
# Check if users have habits:
db.habits.find({userId: ObjectId("...")}).count()

# Verify user goals are set:
db.users.find({}, {goals: 1, level: 1})
```

#### "Low Match Scores"
```bash
# This is normal! Realistic matching shows varied scores
# Perfect matches (90%+) should be rare
# Good matches (70%+) are more common
```

#### "Population Failed"
```bash
# Check MongoDB connection:
mongod --version

# Verify .env file:
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/habit-tracker

# Install dependencies:
npm install
```
